# Welcome to ByT5-Sanskrit

This repository contains inference scripts for Sanskrit analyzers developed by Sebastian Nehrdich and Oliver Hellwig. The analyzer capabilities can be accessed in an interactive application at dharmamitra.org. A publication describing the tools is currently under review. The finetuning data for these models is taken from the [DCS](http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/).  

## Repository Structure

Our project is organized into three main directories. Currently, we make the applications/ section available, we will add the training and data sections in the future. 

- `applications/`: Contains various inference scripts for applying our model.

## Getting Started

For instructions how to run the individual downstream applications, see the README.md files in the subfolders under applications/.
