# Welcome to ByT5-Sanskrit

This repository contains the code for the paper "One Model is All You Need: ByT5-Sanskrit, a Unified Model for Sanskrit NLP Tasks", which is currently under review.

## Repository Structure

Our project is organized into three main directories:

- `applications/`: Contains various inference scripts for applying our model.
- `training/`: Houses the training code (located in a separate repository).
- `datasets/`: Houses the datasets that are described in the paper. 

## Getting Started

For instructions how to run the individual downstream applications, see the README.md files in the subfolders under applications/.
